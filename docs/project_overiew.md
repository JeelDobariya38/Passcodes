# Passcodes Project

An app that take down your headace of remembeing password and auth related sensitive infomation in your head.. It is a secure and robust solution that not only, let you store password in a local storage. but also make the exprience, much more fun and initiative..

## Problem Statement

In morden days, data is important, especially data that has concern with auth infomation.. and store them securly is a serious task (and much of headace). Passcodes try to eliminate this headace. by provide you a simpe, sweet and initiative ui that help you store your password in local storage. (and to extend also in cloud). `which means, you have full control of data you share with passcodes app`.

## Goals

- To make password management process much more intuative, enjoying, customizable & secure. By give you full (or utter more) control over your auth data. (that is shared or stored in passcodes app).
- To simplify password management, yet give extensive control to end users.
- To serve as guide, reference & extensible tool, for all people (nerds) who are interested in making there password management workflow, much more safe, secure and customizable.

## Target Users

1. `Not So Developer, Not So Normal-End-User` First:
    
    Which means,
      - For those, who wish to optimize, there password management workflow.. but don;t how to...
      - For those, who are willing to spend time learning a tool (specifically for password management) & for those how are willing to uncover (disambiguate) abstraction that app uses to make the exprience of storing passwords with passcode much more simpler...
      - For those, who are willing to gain control of there auth data, without that extra headace of remember data that comes with it...
      - For those, who don't mind researching and squim through our documentation for hrs, just for once in a while, to customize & optimize thier password management workflow...

2. `Software Engineer` is our second target users:

   Which means,
     - the source code of the app, will much more likely to be clean, maintainable and extendsiable...
     - developers can make the app, in way they need... we will also have documentaion that one can follow & learn from, about how to extend passcodes app...

3. `End Users` are the least target of application:

   Which means,
     - that the app will made in such way, in which we will try to abstract away the complex concepts in different extensible/decoupled systems... such that end users will more like feel that they are using a simple. but, secure password manageing app...
     - if you fall in this category of target users, then it more like that you will either not use the app to it full potential, or more like you will became password management nerd, as app is full optimised to  promote customization and optimization of your password management workflow...
     - Also, it more like a way to start using/integrating passcodes app into your daily password management workflow... but if wanna continue, then we recommend you, to try learn about your specfic password management workflow and make yourself prompted from just normal end user to a more, better group (as in  `Not So Developer, Not So Normal-End-User` group).. which will make you, the first target of app... which also mean that you will likely use app more effectivly and will (at somepoint) end up optimizing your password management workflow, to make it more secure and customized to your spefic needs...
