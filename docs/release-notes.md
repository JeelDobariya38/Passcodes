`TL;DR`: Our first stable release.. | Not much has change in terms of look and feature.. | Name of project has changed to "Passcodes"..

This is our first stable release, even though it look and behave same as prototype release.
it now more stable and more realiable as the data storage part is now tested and optimised and uses more mordern apporach (room libaray)..
things have change internally also... like app was first build using java.. but, now it is build using kotlin.
now, you can also switch theme and languages in app..
also improve UI/UX by providing help text.. especially as you all have question like "what is domain?" "what can i write in domain?" and so on.....
