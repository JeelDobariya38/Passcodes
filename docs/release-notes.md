Max Android Version = 14 (API level 34)
Version Code = 1
Version Name = "v1.0.0-Stable"
Master Database Version = "v1"
```

`TL;DR`: Our first stable release.. | Not much has change in terms of look and features.. | Name of project has been changed to "Passcodes"..

This is our first stable release, even though, it really look and behave in same way as prototype release..
But it now, more stable and realiable as the data storage feature (module) is now well tested, optimised and uses more mordern apporach (room library)..
Things have also been changed internally... like the app was first built using java.. but, now it is built using kotlin. which like java ultra pro max..
Apart from that, you can now also switch theme and languages in app.. 
Also improve the UI/UX by providing helping text.. Especially as you, all were been question, like "what is domain?", "what can i write/fill in domain?" and so on.....

### v0.1.0-Alpha

```
Pacakage Name = "com.passwordmanager"
Min Android Version = 8.0 (API level 26)
Max Android Version = 13 (API level 33)
Version Code = 1
Version Name = "0.1.0-Alpha"
Master Database Version = "v1"
```

`TL;DR`: Our first initial release.. | Prototype release..

It a very basic prototype release. which means it can have a lot of bugs... (lucky, we haven't discover many)
It has all core features, like save, read, update & delete passwords...
It has basic ui that allow you to do basic things... the ineteface is really intuitive and has more structure...
But structure and intuitive doesn;t necessary means mordern ui... the ui currently is more simple and structured, not so cool and definetly not at all mordern...
