# Release Workflow

In this file you will find documented process about how we release new version of a app.

1. We follow so called `Main as Production Environment`. So, during the time of release we test the main branch code.

2. Updated the Code where ever need. (code that refer to previous version).

3. Make Documentation up-to-date. (document the main change in app from user point of view).

4. Update `changelog.md`

5. Draft a Release with all apk file uploaded (signed apks).
